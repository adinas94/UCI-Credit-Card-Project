# UCI-Credit-Card-Project
This mini-project uses the Kaggle UCI Credit Card dataset, which contains information and factors related to credit card default payments. This Machine Learning project looked at various models: linear, logistic, KNN (with optimal k value), bayes, decision trees (classification & regression), ensemble (bagging & random forest), boosting (Adaboost, XGBoost & Gradient),  and Support Vector Machines (linear & non-linear kernel). The overall aim was to determine which machine learning algorithm was able to best determine the probability that an individual would default on their credit card payment.
